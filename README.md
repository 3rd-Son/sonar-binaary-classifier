# sonar-binaary-classifier

This is a dataset that describes sonar chirp returns bouncing off different services. The 60 input variables are the strength of the returns at different angles. It is a binary classification problem that requires a model to differentiate rocks from metal cylinders.

It is a well-understood dataset. All the variables are continuous and generally in the range of 0 to 1. The output variable is a string “M” for mine and “R” for rock.
